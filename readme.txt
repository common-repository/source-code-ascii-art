Inserts ASCII art in HTML comments into your source code. A quirky surprise for anybody viewing your source! Select from artworks or insert your own.

== Description ==

Source Code ASCII Art inserts an ASCII drawing (in HTML comments) into your site's source code, wherever you specify, using WordPress action hooks or a handy PHP tag. Select from dozens of artworks, or insert your own. That's pretty much the long and short of it!

Nothing is visually changed on your site - the drawing is inserted inside `<!-- -->` tags and is only visible in the HTML markup (zero impact on SEO).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Start asking!

== Known Bugs/Limitations ==

None so far!

Except that you can't put `<` and `>` into the ASCII art under any circumstances - use `(` and `)` instead! The arrow characters can mess up Firefox, and probably IE too.
